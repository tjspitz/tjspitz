  Hello, GitHub World!
</h1>
<nr>

I am a full-stack SWE intern with MARS Solutions Group, a graudate of Hack Reactor's SEI (advanced software engineering immersive) course, 
  and fomerly an Orchestra Teacher of twelve years. This introductory README is not the most impressive
  one you will ever see, as I am spending my days coding, applying for jobs, learning additional techs, and keeping up with my family.
  
## I'm Currently working on...
<ul>
  <li>MARS Full-Stack Project: <a href=https://github.com/tjspitz/MARS/tree/main/elp>E-Learning Platform</a></li>
  <li> Primary Personal Project: <a href=https://github.com/tjspitz/lunatime/tree/main/lunatime>Lunatime</a></li>
</ul>

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrspitz/), which is slightly more impressive-looking than this README.<br>
