  Hello, GitHub World!
</h1>
<nr>

I am a recent graudate of Hack Reactor's SEI (advanced software engineering immersive) course, 
  and a current SEIR (software engineering immersive resident). 
As you might notice, my daily activity on gitHub has dropped a bit during my SEIR role 
  since my routine is currently focused on providing support for SEI students. 
However, I intend to ramp up my personal projects and refactoring of previous projects in the near future. 
Feel free to look through my public repos anytime.
  
## I'm Currently working on...
<ul>
  <li> 💡 Mentoring SEI students as one of Hack Reactor's SEIRs</li>
  <li> 🤔 Personal Project Ideation</li>
  <li> 🖥️ Daily LeetCode practice</li>
</ul>

In the meantime, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrspitz/).<br>
At any rate, stay tuned...
